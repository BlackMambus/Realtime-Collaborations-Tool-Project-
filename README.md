# Realtime-Collaborations-Tool-Project-

This project is about building a dynamic platform that enables multiple users to work together simultaneously on shared digital artifactsâ€”documents, whiteboards, code files, designs, or project boards. The tool ensures ultra-low latency, seamless synchronization, and intelligent conflict resolution to make collaboration feel natural, responsive, and productive.

Itâ€™s like having a virtual workspace where everyoneâ€™s cursor, edits, and ideas come to life instantlyâ€”no refresh buttons, no email ping-pong.
